Thanmai is a contemporary Bharatanatyam performance by NUS Indian Dance,
depicting the search for light, a seemingly intangible element that plays a very
tangible role in our lives.

In the vast wheel of creation, everything is a wheel in itself. Light is energy.
Energy which travels in waves, in regular, modulated patterns - like the cycle of
seasons which come and go. And with each season, come countless moments of
time. It is in these moments, that we find meaning, which shines light on what is
significant; connecting with nature, the universe, and ultimately ourselves, as we
experience a kind of ecstasy or enlightenment. Thanmai is a journey to reflect on
the metaphysical and physical qualities of light and what it means to us as
humans.

In a unique collaboration with visual artist Joshua Yang, electronic music producer
Mario Vanegas and composer-musician Dr Ghanavenothan Retnam and the set
and lighting design by Alberto Wileo, dancers will take audiences on a journey of
time and space, through the beautiful language of Bharatnatyam, to express the
power and beauty of Light.

Thanmai was an exciting project that had been in progress since
December 2021. Our late Artistic Director, Mrs. Santha Bhaskar, worked
tirelessly with the dancers to convey the message behind the show. This
performance is very dear to our heart since it is one of the last choreography
gifted to us by our beloved teacher.
