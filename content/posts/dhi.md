Dhi is a Sanskrit word that has multiple interpretations such as "imagination", "meditation" or "reflection". Dhi invites the audience on a journey of self-discovery to seek answers from pressing internal conflict. Complex sentiments, which cannot be expressed in words, will be brought to life by Bharatanatyam. This dance film is an excerpt from the original stage production of Dhi, as part of the ExxonMobil Campus Concerts in NUS, which was cancelled due to COVID-19.
