In Maargam, alumni dancers of NUS Indian Dance returned as choreographers under the guidance of Artistic Director Mrs Santha Bhaskar to introduce a new section/element to the traditional format- one where the dancer finds room, time and inspiration to create new movements and choreographies and play with dance - where freedom is not restricted to enacting a story.
